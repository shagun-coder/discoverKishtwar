          It is unclear when humans first arrived in Paddar. Some theories suggest it was first settled in the 8th century by people from Kashmir, and the northwestern region of the subcontinent (Kpk or Eastern afganistan).[3] They could be the descendants of ancient White Huns or Scythians. The area is inhabited mostly by the Thakurs and Brahmins .[3] There is also an interesting thing to know many villages in the region have name that include Kashmiri surnames. E.g Bhatwas- literally translating to the Place or Abode of Bhats Ganjuwas- the Abode of Ganjusy people from Kashmir, and the northwestern region of the subcontinent (Kpk or Eastern Afghanistan). The area is inhabited mostly by the <strong>Thakurs and Brahmins.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>Rule and Annexation</h4>
        <p>
          Paddar was under the rule of the Kashmiri Empire for centuries. Various manuscripts written in Sharada script have been found in the region. But most of the period of the history it remained under self rule because it was a difficult region to be accessible. At local level, the area were headed by local Ranas. Each Rana usually controlled one to three villages, often fighting with other Ranas for control of land. By the mid-17th century, Rana Sheetal Singh controlled the valley, being headquartered at Leondi village. Sheetal Singh was defeated in an ambush by the Raja of Chamba and his forces, and Paddar fell into the hands of Chamba rulers. After Chatur Singh's reign, the Rajas of Chamba exercised their sovereignty over Padder for six generations. The area enjoyed peace and prosperity thereafter. In the spring of 1836 A.D., Zorawar Singh took up arms against the Chamba forces and won, causing Paddar to be annexed to Kishtwar. Due to its history under Chamaba rule, Paddar has a strong relationship with Himachal Pradesh in terms of culture and history.
        </p>
        <h4>Early Religion</h4>
        <p>
          The residents of ancient Paddar were primarily serpent worshipers. However, they observed other Hindu rites and rituals as well. Besides Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists also settled in the valley. The Buddhists were spread in the upper reaches of the Machail, Kaban, and Gandhari valleys and in the town of Gulabgarh.The first Muslims came to Paddar during the period of the Raja Shantar Kantar from Chamba. The descendants of those Muslims still live in Atholi and Kijai.

          Majority of the Padderi belong to the Hindu community but their traditions and rituals are very different from the mainstream Hinduism. They follow a unique Shiva-Shakti traditions which is much similar to the Kashmir Shavism. They worship the nature and its sacred elements e.g Zehryun devta or Megh raj who is the god of Clouds and snow (Lord Indra), Jwala mata, the god of fire, warmth and prosperity. They worship nagas i.e snake gods also. Temples of different Nag devtas or Serpent Gods are still visible and are adorned with wood carvings of snakes of all kinds. Goddesses Parvati i.e Shakti is worshipped in different forms such as Kali, Chandi , Sheetla devi etc. Different festivals are organised for their local dietes on which customary dances and rituals are performed. They use dhoons and beinch(flute) to play ragad of devi-devtas. In every household 3 important ceremonies are held for every individual i.e Bishtyan ( Yagyopavit) irrespective of their castes, Byah (Marriage) and the last rites.
        </p>
        <h3>Music and dance</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the isolation from the rest of the world the region has special and unique dance forms that developed gradually by the phase of time. The local songs are called gheet. A unique form of singing in which the words are sung slowly and generally used to describe an event is called Sugil. The most famous dance form of the region is kharzath. It is similar to the Kud dance of Jammu region which is performed on special occasions and in temple. Gurhey is a dance form performed by the women. They sing the songs holding each others' hand or should and move slowly by matching footsteps . Is is similar to the rauf dance of Kashmir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women wear a woolen shawl called chador and special caps called Zuji. Men wear a loose tunic called <strong>kamïr (or kamri) with a woolen belt called mazerad.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>clothing</h4>
        <p>
          In order to adapt to the cold and harsh climate of the region the residents wear wollen garments all round the year. The women wear shalwar kameez inside, and cover it with a light but heat insulating wollen shawl called chador which is draped in a unique manner. Women wear special caps called Zuji on their heads. And this Zuji resemble the caps worn by kalash tribe in Chitral areas. This cap must be having a unique historic significance which is still unknown to the world. Women used to wear heavy silver jewellery which included head jwellery, big ear rings and nose pins, and heavy silver necklace in older times. Men wear a loose long kurta like tunic called kamïr or kamri with a chudidar lower which is tight from bottom but loose above the knees. They often wear a belt piece of wool called mazerad.

        <h4>Some Notable Festivals of Paddar</h4>
        <ul class="spiritual-list">
          <li><strong>Shivratri (Sheraeth):</strong> Shivratri, locally known as Sheraeth, is the most famous and significant festival of the Padder Valley. It is celebrated with great enthusiasm and devotion, involving numerous rituals, beliefs, and deep spirituality. The festival lasts for four days. The first two days are called Rekh and Kandey. According to local belief, these are the days when demons, spirits, and witches celebrate the festival. In the morning, after thoroughly cleaning and purifying their homes, people cover their doors and windows with thorns and leaves. In the evening, when no one remains outside, a rekha (white line) is drawn across the main entrance to prevent any negative energy from entering the house. People also draw portraits of demons on their rooftops and stay indoors all night, praying and playing kaudi, as it is believed that Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati loved this game.
